     <h2>1st Year College</h2>
      <p>Life in college is the period when the adolescent years end and we all dive deep into the ocean of new beginnings and possibilities, making it one of the most fascinating times in life that provides you the chance to explore. You are better prepared for all of the problems you'll face in life because to this golden period, which also builds a solid knowledge base for you.
One important lesson I took away from my time at IIT Roorkee is that life is unpredictable. Expect anything to happen, regardless of how fantastic, horrible, strange, or uninteresting it may be. For instance, you can be doing great right now and get fired the next. College life teaches you how to deal with all kinds</p>

      <h2>2nd Year College</h2>
      <p>You won't ever have as much free time to do the things you love as you do in college. Additionally, you'll never have the chance to interact with so many of your classmates through campus events  Look into the clubs, groups, and Greek life at your school. The college years are the ideal time to explore a new interest or learn more about one you already have  w hatever you choose to do, you are under no obligation to continue if you ultimately decide you don't enjoy it. But ideally, you'll have gained one or two new pals in the process  It's fun to come together with other students and support your school, even if you're not a big sports enthusiast. Depending on your school's size,</p>
