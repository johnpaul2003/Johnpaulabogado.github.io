      <h2>Grade 1</h2>
      <p>It is a year full of new experiences and adventures for us to learn and grow by maturing into children instead of toddlers. My first grade year will forever be an important year in my mind and heart because during this year I truly learned how much family, especially parents, impact my life.</p>

      <h2>Grade 2</h2>
      <p>As I was walking into a new classroom my second grade year, I could feel my heart pounding as I opened the door to a room full of new faces. All of the children were extremely friendly and I made friends immediately. The day begins with the teacher telling us a plethora of exciting activities we would be doing in the coming year, the main one being a Thanksgiving play.</p>

      <h2>Grade 3</h2>
      <p>My school has a beautiful campus with two big playgrounds. One is at the front and the other behind the school building. I play dodge-ball with my friends at one of the playgrounds. We also play cricket, football, hide-and-seek in the playground. My school has several small gardens. There are roses, sunflowers, and marigolds in these gardens. These flowers make my school look even more beautiful.</p>
